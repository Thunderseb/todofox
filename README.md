[TodoFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/todofox/) is a simple Todo List located in the sidebar. This is not a "website related" addon as Todoist !

You can create Folders and add Tasks in it. For every task, you can define the color, an important flag and a link, plus a description. All the stuff is stored using the Bookmarks system provided by Firefox, so it can be sync using Firefox Sync or Xmarks.
